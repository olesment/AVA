# Special addresses
IPv4 address = 32 bit = 4 octet = 206.190.36.45 [<= this is a dotted quad] ==> for computers that is 32 bit long string of bits
> 206.190.36.45 => 11001110101111100010010000101101 [1010 takes 32 places => 32 bits]

Not all 32-bit values are open for geneeral usage, some of them are designated for special uses. About 1/8 of IPv4 is set aside for special uses

## General number of IPv4 addresses
> 1 bit - 2 addresses
> 2 bit - 4 addresses
> 3 bit - 8 addresses
> ...
> 32 bit - 4294967296 addresses

That amount of addresses is still less than the amount of population on the planet + many people have multiple connected devices. How is there enough ips?

## Netblocks and subnets.

Longer the prefix, less is left over to assign to different clients on the same network.
Network prefix length is chosen when the network is set up. 
It is usually configured by whatever process that assigns addresses to the computers (the ISP?)

> 198.51.100.143
> 198.51.100.17
> in these examples first 3 numbers are the same and that means that theres 8 bits
> of room left fot the host part [_place where numbers are different_] 
> this is also a 24-bit [_/24_] network part
> Usual writing style: 198.51.100.0/24
> If less number woul be the same then network would be called /XX<24 network and 8+ bits would be open for 
> assigning to hosts

### How many hosts fit on /22 network?

22 = 10 bits are open
10 bits = 2^10 addresses = 1024

! top and the bottom addresses are usually reserved.\
! first address is usually a router

**this means that 1021 addresses are available for hosts**

24 = 8-bit => 2^8 addresses = 256.\
256 - 3 [_top, bottom, router_] = 253 addresses are for hosts

## Subnet masks
Subnet mask is another way to write a network size.\
Its often used in network configuration.\
Mask is made out of 32 numbers [0,1] where 1 and 0 are grouped, 1 to the left and 0 to the right
> 24-bit netblock\
> 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\
> _____255._____255._____255._______0

_Q: whats the subnet mask for /16 network_ .\
_A: 255.255.0.0_ 


## Not enough addresses
! All network traffic is in packets.\
Packets always contain sender anf recipient addresses

## The host is a lie
Computers kind of dont have IP addresses, IP-s belong to interfaces on hosts
One machine can have multiple interfaces like WiFi ethernet and loopback (for talking to itself), can have a VM, 
### Loopback interface
On linux you can use 
`$ ip addr show`
in google shell it showed loopback, docker 0, eth0@ifil.\
Ipv4-s were: 127.0.0.1/8, 172.18.0.1/16, 172.17.0.4/16

Loopback [_lo_]is a special interface that almost always has ip: 127.0.0.1/8

### Localhost
allows programs to use network stack to talk to other programs on the same host

## Routers and default gateways
- Acts as a gateway
- Connects two different IP networks (Like LAN and WAN?)
- Router has 2 or more IPv4 Addresses

**Default gateway**
Default gateway is a router that is connected towards the internet

! Computers that are connected to same WAP [_Wifi acces point_] are usually on the same network and can send data directly to eachother. 

**Global routing table**
Its the directory of all public IP networks.\
Their routers dont have default gateways.\
These routers are reached eventually whn data is sent out to a host that isnt on the same network.\

**Finding default gateway**
- Linux `$ ip route show default`
- >:~ (focus-mechanic-364711)$ netstat -nr
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
0.0.0.0         172.17.0.1      0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
172.17.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 eth0
172.18.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 docker0 \
 (focus-mechanic-364711)$ ip route show default
default via 172.17.0.1 dev eth0
- Windows `ipconfig`

My gateways default IPv4 address is [wont tell you]
Speed to that address was 2ms. 

## NAT
To avoid shotrage usually ISP assigns only one address to each household.
Inside the household theres a different network
Bidirectional transition is done by nat
Home network -> router [default gateway]-> isp -> isp returns single real IP address -> router -> assigns prvate addresses to all devices in home network
NAT - network addresses translation

> Whenever traffic goes between private network and public internet, router has torewrite or translate to the network adresses on it.

Router keeps track, maps, which inside addresses and ports are connected to what public internet addresses and ports

- Nat is quite error prone, its still difficult to establish a connecions and one needs to resort to "hacky protocols" workaround

## Private and public
Private addesses dont mean that theyre concelased, theyre private cause theyre only any good on local network
Theyre not unique thats why they cant be used on the  public network



-------------------
### Glossary
- dotted quad - 206.190.36.45 that is 32 bit numeric value.\
- octet - [206].[190]......11111111.00000000 octet because there are total of 8 characters in octet in binary.\
- router - device that connects two different IP networks [Like lan and Wan?]. Acts like a gateway .\.\
- chunk - a subnet, that local network is split into to ease network traffic.\
- Loopback - a special interface that almost always has ip: 127.0.0.1/8 .\
- LAN - locan network, thats where "my" devices are .\
- WAN - WIde Area Network outward facing connection that connects my "interface host (?)" (router) to the rest of the internet .\
- NAT - Network addresses translation

## IPv6
- Ipv6 is written in Hex
- 128 bits
- 2^128Zeroes are skipped :
- on blocks of 2 bytes
