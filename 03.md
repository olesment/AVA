# Special addresses
IPv4 address = 32 bit = 4 octet = 206.190.36.45 [<= this is a dotted quad] ==> for computers that is 32 bit long string of bits
> 206.190.36.45 => 11001110101111100010010000101101 [1010 takes 32 places => 32 bits]

Not all 32-bit values are open for geneeral usage, some of them are designated for special uses. About 1/8 of IPv4 is set aside for special uses

## General number of IPv4 addresses
> 1 bit - 2 addresses
> 2 bit - 4 addresses
> 3 bit - 8 addresses
> ...
> 32 bit - 4294967296 addresses

That amount of addresses is still less than the amount of population on the planet + many people have multiple connected devices. How is there enough ips?

## Netblocks and subnets.

Longer the prefix, less is left over to assign to different clients on the same network.
Network prefix length is chosen when the network is set up. 
It is usually configured by whatever process that assigns addresses to the computers (the ISP?)

> 198.51.100.143
> 198.51.100.17
> in these examples first 3 numbers are the same and that means that theres 8 bits
> of room left fot the host part [_place where numbers are different_] 
> this is also a 24-bit [_/24_] network part
