#Special addresses

IPv4 address = 32 bit = 4 octet = 206.190.36.45 [<= this is a dotted quad] ==> for computers that is 32 bit long string of bits
> 206.190.36.45 => 11001110101111100010010000101101 [1010 takes 32 places => 32 bits]

Not all 32-bit values are open for geneeral usage, some of them are designated for special uses. About 1/8 of IPv4 is set aside for special uses
