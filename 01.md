# From ping to HTTP

For linux server we use google shell

## Setting up for this course
> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\
> sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd tcpdump traceroute mtr\

## Try some network things
> Ip addr show eth 0	\
> Ip route show	\
> Ping -c3 8.8.8.8\
> Host -t aaaa google.com\
> Host -t mx udacity.com\
> Tcpdump -n -c5 -I eth0 port 22\	
> Traceroute www.udacity.com\
> Mtr www.udacity.com\
> Mtr www.google.com\
> printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.udacity.com \r\n\r\n' \|nc www.udacity.com 80\

## Ping 8.8.8.8
Ping is a command to test whether a computer can send and recieve network traffic with that address\
- c3 means to send three test messages, then quit and print results\
All traffic on the Inet is split into short messages called packets.\
They contain addresses of sender and receiver\
Ping command sends and receives individual packets\
> put in http://8.8.8.8 and got to a google public dns page. \

## Ping Vs HTTP
We can do a http request and get a webpage back even though the network in the middle doesnt know that web pages are a thing\
Ping is different, it sends a message request [echo] and directly to recipients OS\
In http and ssh theres a server program that composes a response and sends it back\
with ping theres no ping server\
every os that supports IN access, cupports ping aswell\
HTTP is not based on ping\

## write your own HTTP to wikiedia
`printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org\r\n\r\n' | nc en.wikipedia.org 80`\
Answer is in the picture above\
First rewuest didnt do anything, second told me host name and HTML version of the page at that address perhaps\

Real answer: we got back some onfo like HTML header, bunch of header fields, cookies\

## Prinf and netcat
printf is a shell command for printing formatted strings\
if you run it by itself, it just [rints out whats written afeer original printf, whoch is a http request\
you can print anthining there and it just returns what you printed\
its like echo but smarter, it recognizes some thoings, like backslash n as a linebreak\

nc stands for netcat

its a tool to manually talk to internet services\
nc doesnt know anything about http in particular\
nc can be used to connest to various servers [ nc __request__]\
Nc can act as a server itself\
| is a pipe that says that take the output of previous and feed to the following\
>printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.udacity.com \r\n\r\n' \|nc www.udacity.com 80\	
inthis case we take output of print and feed it to nc. \
nc takes that and sends it over the network to en.wikipedia.org 80 and displays the output\

## What web server does google use?
this `printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.udacity.com \r\n\r\n' \|nc www.udacity.com 80`\
has host command of www.wiki... in two places.\
Second one is telling netcat what address it should connect to\
first one is printed out into that connection, sent by a printf to nc. through the| \
A google uses gws as a web server\
its in this answer: 
> server: gws

## Printf and netcat illustrate layers
nc and http dont know wnything about eachother, tet we can feed stuff from one to other and gt meaningful response\
NC sends a string over net\
to web server that string looks like HTTP request\
previous request separated 2 layers of activity:\
- text of the http req (prinf)
-  connect to a port, transmit some data, get some results part\
Http is implemented by progtams like browsers and servers\
lower level TCP operating in the OS\
nc is a thin wrapper over TCP\
Ietf model\
> layer | protocols| concepts\
> application [top layer]| http,ssh |Urls passwords [these things make sense to web browsers or SSh clans]| \
> [transport layer] | TCP, UDP | port numbers, sessions [tcp and udp provide things like port nrs..] |\ 
> internet [is basically same as one single protocol IP]|  IP | ip addresses and routes| \ 
> Hardware | wifi, ethernet, DSL [ip runs in top if this]| signal strength, access points |\

sonme protocol dont exactly fit in above, but everything above and below goes through IP\

## Listen to a port
What is a server, what program does\
that can be investigated with `nc`\
`man nc` \
