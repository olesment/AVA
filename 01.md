# From ping to HTTP

For linux server we use google shell

## Setting up for this course
> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\
> sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd tcpdump traceroute mtr\

## Try some network things
> Ip addr show eth 0	\
> Ip route show	\
> Ping -c3 8.8.8.8\
> Host -t aaaa google.com\
> Host -t mx udacity.com\
> Tcpdump -n -c5 -I eth0 port 22\	
> Traceroute www.udacity.com\
> Mtr www.udacity.com\
> Mtr www.google.com\
> printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.udacity.com \r\n\r\n' \|nc www.udacity.com 80\

## Ping 8.8.8.8
Ping is a command to test whether a computer can send and recieve network traffic with that address\
- c3 means to send three test messages, then quit and print results\
All traffic on the Inet is split into short messages called packets.\
They contain addresses of sender and receiver\
Ping command sends and receives individual packets\
> put in http://8.8.8.8 and got to a google public dns page. \

## Ping Vs HTTP
We can do a http request and get a webpage back even though the network in the middle doesnt know that web pages are a thing\
Ping is different, it sends a message request [echo] and directly to recipients OS\
In http and ssh theres a server program that composes a response and sends it back\
with ping theres no ping server\
every os that supports IN access, cupports ping aswell\
HTTP is not based on ping\

## write your own HTTP to wikiedia
`printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org\r\n\r\n' | nc en.wikipedia.org 80`\
Answer is in the picture above\
First rewuest didnt do anything, second told me host name and HTML version of the page at that address perhaps\

Real answer: we got back some onfo like HTML header, bunch of header fields, cookies\

## Prinf and netcat
printf is a shell command for printing formatted strings\
if you run it by itself, it just [rints out whats written afeer original printf, whoch is a http request\
you can print anthining there and it just returns what you printed\
its like echo but smarter, it recognizes some thoings, like backslash n as a linebreak\

nc stands for netcat
